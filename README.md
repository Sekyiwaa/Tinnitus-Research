## Overview

This study investigates the genesis of tinnitus and utilizes supervised learning techniques on real-world data, specifically focusing on tinnitus as a distressing condition and its treatments. The UK's internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus is explored, and the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score is used as a primary assessment tool.

## Introduction

The introduction section discusses the impact of tinnitus on quality of life and the intervention methods designed to treat it using online cognitive behavioral therapy in the UK.

## Literature Review

The literature review covers theories and writings on tinnitus, its types, causes, and the lack of definitive trials confirming the effectiveness of most clinical interventions. Tinnitus is complex, involving both auditory and neural components.

## Method

The methodology involves multiple linear regression and K-MEAN regression techniques to correlate several predictors with the TFI score reduction, using Python for data analysis and diagnostic checks for the modelâ€™s assumptions.

## Analysis and Discussion

Key analyses include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checking for Missing Values
- Data Partitioning
- Modeling and Predictions
- Influencing Factors of Reduction in TFI Score
- KNN Regression

## Python Code

The appendix includes Python code used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning models to predict TFI score reduction.
